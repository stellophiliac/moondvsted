            <h1>hello!</h1>
            <p>hi! welcome to the kode korner! this is just a little section of my website specifically dedicated to coding-related stuff</p>
            <p>this page is pretty empty, but maybe one day i'll fill it with more stuff........</p>

            <h1>coding?</h1>
            <p>i love coding! i'm not very good at it but i think it's fun!</p>
            <h2>html/css</h2>
            <p>i mainly make stuff with html/css. i don't think it counts as programming, but i think it's coding?</p>
            <p>i started with making stuff for myself on deviantart, but i got into coding with bootstrap on toyhouse! i made this website with my bare hands (albeit with a lot of help from the internet) and i'm pretty proud of it!</p>
            <h2>python</h2>
            <p>python's fun too! as of the time of writing this, i've been doing a python course thing. i'm still very new to it, but it's nice to learn (even if it's kind of confusing sometimes)</p>
