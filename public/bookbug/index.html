                        <h3>before reading</h3>
                        <p>honestly i don't really understand the synopsis on storygraph (and i'm too scared of spoilers
                            to look elsewhere online). i wonder if the narrator will be telling a story about himself,
                            or if he's making his own story? or some combination, or maybe it's less of a story and more
                            of like... just his thoughts (since the description references him writing a "narrative" and
                            i'm not really sure what that entails)</p>
                        <p>looks like an intruiging book, i think it'll be interesting to see how this pans out since
                            the narrator is isolated and so the book will probably be less about his interactions and
                            experiences (?) and more about what's going on in his head</p>
                        <h3>comments</h3>
                        <p>so i was... barely able to start this book honestly. the writing wasn't as wordy as TLHoD, but it still had huge text blocks that were difficult to read, and the premise just wasn't super interesting to me, unfortunately.</p>

                        <h3>before reading</h3>
                        <p>i haven't actually heard of this book before (the books for this book
                            club seem quite
                            different from what i generally read, which is one of the
                            reasons i joined), but i have
                            enjoyed science fiction before, so hopefully i'll enjoy this as
                            well
                        </p>

                                        so far, especially since the author
                                        just throws a bunch
                                        of proper nouns at you – but it should
                                        make sense in due time. the plot seems a
                                        bit interesting, but the book hasn't
                                        really captivated me yet. it feels kind

                                        dense, which impacts readability a

                                        this book hasn't really been able to
                                        captivate me – i don't really feel
                                        strongly
                                        about
                                        it one way or another at the moment. i'm

                                        book by
                                        the end of the month, which is a shame
                                        because it really does seem interesting.
                                        i've had to look at litcharts to be able
                                        to follow the story – i did hear that
                                        this book is a hard read, and i'm
                                        inexperienced with this sort of writing,
                                        so i
                                        guess it's to be expected.

                                        thoughts on the story, i do like
                                        genly's interactions with other
                                        characters. his thoughts on gethen as an
                                        outsider are interesting, and i do like
                                        the worldbuilding even if i can't
                                        understand it all. </p>

                                        can't. if i'm still interested in it,

                            <p>finished this book on the last day of the month aw yeah !!!
                            </p>
                            <p>i wasn't super into this book at the start but i got really
                                invested around halfway through.</p>
                            <p>i really liked genly's
                                relationship with estraven and their interactions. estraven was cheering genly on from
                                the start but he didn't trust him until the end. and then he loses him. auhg. auhgshg
                            </p>
                            <p>i liked the worldbuilding, some stuff was confusing but the
                                author really does well in making us feel like we're
                                reading a story from another planet because. we are</p>
                            <p>genly's changing attitude and understanding towards the
                                people of gethen throughout the book was interesting; i
                                personally didn't really get most of the politics stuff (which i KNOW i'm missing out on
                                but i've never had a good understanding of politics)
                                but genly's changing thoughts on gethenian gender i
                                especially liked. i heard ursula k. le guin talked about regretting the use of he/him
                                for gethenians, but i think it makes sense since genly comes from a world with binary
                                genders so it'd feel more natural for him to do that. also love the part where he
                                finally gets a good understanding of gethenian gender and then turns around and
                                describes women in the most misogynistic way</p>
                            <p>the ending. holy fuck the ending. tragic. i don't have
                                the words to describe how i feel but auhghg</p>
