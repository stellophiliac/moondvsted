            <p>been a while since i posted here. truthfully, i don't really have anything really meaningful to talk about, and i suck at writing. i was working on a draft a couple months back, but i sorta gave up</p>
            <p>but i do feel sorta obligated to put <i>something</i> here so it doesn't sit covered in dust, so here are some</p>
            <h2>misc. life updates</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>i moved this summer, back to the country i used to live a few years ago when i moved away. nice to see old friends.</li>
                <li>i made a gemini capsule, a couple months ago. you can find it at stel.cities.yesterweb.org in a gemini browser. i haven't really been working on it as of late, cause my motivation fluctuates a lot</li>
                <li>i've been working on a <a href="https://toyhou.se/~world/144859.transcendence">worldbuilding thing</a> lately. if you like sci-fi, maybe give it a look, but there's not much info there yet</li>
                <li>i got a thing set up so i can edit my site with github, which makes it very slightly easier</li>
                <li>i'm learning some toki pona</li>
                <li>i FINALLY started learning javascript despite my reluctance</li>
                <li>i have finals week next week and i am coding instead of studying. please somebody help me</li>
            </ul>
            <p>honestly i don't really know what to write. i kind of suck at writing about myself / my life and that's sort of the entire point of a blog. i mean i could totally write about my interests, but i don't ahve any ideas in the way of that, either.</p>
            <p>penelope scott's released some new music recently which i have been very happy about since i've been really into her music since early 2021. her albums have a lot of previously unreleased songs, some that i've been really excited to see so that's really fun for me</p>
            <p>i'm one of those people who imagine animatics in their head to music, and penelope's music has been evoking a lot of stuff in my head. i am genuiinely so frustrated i can't just mind beam all of my ideas to my friend's brains. what the fuck do you mean i have to actually <i>make</i> the ideas in my head? what?</p>
            <p>i do really wanna add more stuff to my website, but i really don't know what. also, coding is the type of shit that's fun when you're thinking about it but absolute hell to actually do</p>
            <p>besides that, nothing new much from me, i guess. if you <i>do</i> wanna see more of me, my <a href="https://stellophiliac.tumblr.com/">tumblr</a>'s a good place to go. i post my thoughts there sometimes that are too short to put in a blog post</p>
            <p>until next time!</p>
