                            <p>finally got around to watching this show. </p>
                            <p>the characters' behavior felt kinda weird/self aware at parts, but it's not a huge deal.
                                i
                                presume the main characters are teens, so it makes sense they'd act a bit awkward.<br>
                                i also find it kinda interesting that the bots have organic-like functions, like
                                producing
                                sweat and saliva.</p>
                            <p>seems like an interesting show so far (though i am biased as a robot enjoyer)</p>
                        </details>

                        <h3>ep 3</h3>
                        <p><b>date watched:</b> march 11, 2024</p>
                        <details>

                            <p>oh this shit is getting gory (?). this isn't the type of gore that makes me uncomfortable
                                though so this is still fun to watch for me</p>
                            <p>kinda confused about the fact that one girl speaks russian (is there lore significance
                                there? or is that just her thing)</p>
                            <p>i don't super understand the solver thing yet but i'm sure that'll be explained more</p>
                            <p>there were also some implied n x uzi things in this episode i think. not sure how i feel
                                about that, their relationship feels like it moreso fits found family than something
                                romantic to me at this point, but we'll see<br>
                                i feel like making them fall for each other at this stage is a bit rushed also, they
                                just read as good friends to me<br>
                                though they are teenagers so that could definitely influence it</p>
                            <p>anyways i'm enjoying this show so far, might watch a couple of the next episodes with one
                                of my friends</p>
                        </details>

                        <h3>ep 4</h3>

                            <p>watched this episode with my friend. i'm not a huge fan of the time jumps between episodes, i feel like we don't really get enough time to follow along the characters and get to know them but yknow limited resources and all</p>
                            <p>feels like they're really pushing / implying n x uzi here, still not my thing but honestly their portrayal is making it hard to hate</p>
                            <p>i still haven't super caught the plot yet but i'm still having fun watching this nonetheless</p>
