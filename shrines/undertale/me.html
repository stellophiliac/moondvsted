<h2>UNDERTALE and Me</h2>
<p>I found out about UNDERTALE through the Steven Universe fandom -- mainly through those "Stronger Than You" parodies. DanTDM's playthrough was the first one I watched, and I've been in love with the game ever since.</p>
<p>My favorite characters are Napstablook and Temmie. It's too hard to choose a favorite track, but I love "It's Raining Somewhere Else" and "Another Medium"!</p>
