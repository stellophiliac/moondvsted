      <h3 style="margin-top:0">disclaimer: i'm not some sort of, like, gender expert or anything. everyone experiences
        gender differently, and what i say may not apply to you or others</h3>

      <p>hey there! so, gender's a thing that exists, yeah?</p>
      <p>it's one of many social constructs. and like a lot of social constructs, or, well, things in general, it gets
        really confusing if you think too hard about it.</p>
      <p>as a probably-not-cis person, i'd like to say:</p>
      <h2>what the FUCK is going on?</h2>
      <p>that wasn't enlarged for exaggeration. well, it was, but it's also a heading. welcome!</p>
      <p>well, what is gender?</p>
      <p>it's, as i've said, a social construct. generally, people are gendered the same as their sex until they realize
        their gender isn't congruent with their sex... or something. how do i explain this</p>
      <p>.....aaaand if your sex and gender aren't congruent, you're probably genderqueer!</p>
      <p>gender can be masculine or feminine, but it can also be both, or neither.</p>
      <p>everyone experiences gender a little or a lot differently, even people who use the same label. that's all you
        really figure out, honestly, just what label fits you most.</p>
      <h2>how does one figure out their gender?</h2>
      <p>where's the gender stored? what does gender feel like? who knows!</p>
      <p>one thing i heard is that you don't "feel" your gender unless you're uncomfortable with the way you're being
        gendered: much like how you don't feel your bones unless something's wrong. i have no clue whether that's
        correct or not -- as you can probably tell, there's no gender clarity here.</p>
      <p>for me, gender is sort of just.... vibes. my gender is fluid (i think?) so whenever i try to figure out what
        gender i am-- which i've pretty much given up on-- i just try out some labels and see how they resonate. trying
        out pronouns on yourself is also a good method, but if your gender and pronouns tend to fluctuate seperately,
        that might not help</p>
      <p>sometimes, it just comes to you randomly. you'll be making your bed or putting together a sandwich and
        suddenly-- "hey, maybe i'm....."</p>
      <p>having friends can make things easier, i think. if you have a friend group, you'll probably be there to hear
        yourself being talked about in the third person, which can help you figure out if you're comfortable with the
        way you're being gendered. if you're lucky to have a supportive group of friends, you can ask them to gender you
        a certain way, to see if you're comfortable!</p>
      <p>either way, figuring out your gender isn't an easy thing. it definitely takes more time for some than others--
        and for some people who aren't neurotypical, gender is even harder to comprehend. sometimes, there's nothing you
        can really do: it'll come to you eventually, hopefully.</p>
      <p>or maybe not.</p>
      <h2>my gender</h2>
      <p>here's the obligatory "my experiences" section! woo!</p>
      <p>the label i've settled on for now is genderfae: basically genderfluid sans masc.</p>
      <img
        src="https://www.costumepartyworld.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/650x/040ec09b1e35df139433887a97daa66f/1/0/10092020.jpg">
      <p>no</p>
      <p>i feel feminine, i think? i'm pretty comfortable being gendered that way, but i like being gendered neutrally
        too. i'm fine with "masc" terms if it's casual/joking: eg. "i'm just a little guy! aha!"</p>
      <p>but my gender isn't just "girl", there's something else there too. maybe i'm an enby/fem demigirl, maybe i'm a
        libragirl, maybe i'm something else.... i can never seem to figure it out, hence my choice of label.</p>
      <p>honestly, i've been questioning my gender for so long-- do i even have one?</p><br><br><br>
      <p>wait</p><br><br><br><br>
      <p>anyhow, it doesn't really matter. i'm sort of just talking into the void here.</p>
      <p>thanks for listening, void.</p><br>

        that concludes my first actual blog post! sorry if my writing is subpar-- i'm not very experienced with this.
        i'm also not very funny<br>
        if you found this interesting-- or me marginally funny-- feel free to <a href="../../guestbook.html">sign my
          guestbook</a>, or something!<br><br>
        maybe i should add a comment section.</small>
