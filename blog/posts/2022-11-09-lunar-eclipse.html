            <p>as you might know, yesterday (the 8th) was a total lunar eclipse, and on the full moon, too! total eclipses usually happen every year and a half or so, but the next one won't be for about three years.</p>
            <p>it was a pretty cool experience -- the moon was super pretty, and i hope you all got to see it too!</p>
            <p>i didn't get any pictures, unfortunately (not that it'd look good on my camera, anyway), but i'm still super glad i got to see it</p>
            <p>anyways, that's just a cool thing i wanted to share</p>
