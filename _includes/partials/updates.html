* not much, but i added an old song to the [music page](/music/). look for **"it's raining somewhere else (lo-fi remix)"**
* in other news, school's out for the summer. i'll be traveling, but hopefully i'll be able to do more for the site as well
* testing out this new update format â€“ not sure if i'll keep it, but it seems useful for updates with more content.
