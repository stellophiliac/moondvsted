                <p>i made this website not only to get better at webdev, but also because the idea of having
                    my
                    own space on the internet appealed to me. this was my first big web project – i'd
                    experimented with shrines and such before, but i'd never really made anything meant to
                    be
                    maintained and built upon over a long period of time. this site has improved since it's
                    been
                    made; this is currently the third recode, but the layout is still the same as it used to
                    be.
                    guess i just like this too much?</p>
                <p>the main accent colors of this site are pantone's rose quartz and serenity. the
                    background is a f2u pattern i found from a now-deactivated tumblr blog.</p>

            <p>this is my site's mascot, <a href="https://toyhou.se/15321087.starlet" target="_blank">starlet</a>!<sub> (they/ae)</sub> their
                head was originally going to be a crescent moon, but
                i
                ended up making them a bubblehead instead. their color palette is based off of the site's
                palette, so they fit right in.</p>
