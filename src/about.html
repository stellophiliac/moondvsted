            <p>i'm stel, or D-17840 if that floats your boat. she/her, they/them, or it/its (or whatever's
                funniest
                in a specific situation). generation z, dubiously human</p>
            <p>i've been maintaining this site since 2022. i go by stellophiliac or pastelsparkyl most places on
                the
                internet.</p>
            <p>i'm an aspiring artist of several varieties — visual art is my specialty, but i dabble in music
                and
                writing pretty often. of course, web development is its own sort of art.</p>

            <h2>the website</h2>
            <p>i made this site not only to get better at web-dev, but also because the idea of having a personal
                webspace appealed to me. this was the first big web project i made, meant to be maintained for a long
                time — it's done wonders for my coding skill, honestly. with that improvement, this site has of course
                improved since its conception; this is the third recode, but the layout's essentially the same. perhaps
                i just like it too much?</p>
            <p>the main accent colors of this site are pantone's rose quartz and serenity. the background is a f2u
                pattern i found from a now-deactivated tumblr blog. for credits and such, check the <a
