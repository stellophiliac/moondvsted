{% renderTemplate "md" %}
dec 27, 2024:
* updated my HTML and CSS to hopefully be more valid. it might not work on outdated browsers due to nesting, but it's a
fair tradeoff to avoid (sparkles) selector hell
    * my sidebar headings are now _larger_, strangely. this is due to an interaction with `h1`, `section`, and `aside`
    (i replaced them with `h2`). it feels weird to me, i dunno
* removed the lastFM thingie on my homepage for now.
* added some cute buttons to the [colophon](/colophon)
***
dec 26, 2024:
* added quite a bit to the [writing](/writing/) and [reading](/reading/) pages!
    * ie. a fan works section to the writing page and a recommendations section to the reading page (+ restructured the
reading logs a bit)
* after much deliberation i've decided to capitalize book titles and author names, at least in headings... if i
lowercase a book or an author i promise it's not disrespect it's just how i write (kind of weird to break into proper
caps in the middle of a paragraph y'know?)
***
dec 21, 2024: i made a couple new [buttons](/links/) at the airport
***
dec 19, 2024: replaced the deprecated `center` element.
***
dec 18, 2024: i replaced most marquees on the site with a CSS + JS replacement, courtesy of
[metemo](https://metemo.neocities.org/marquee/)! unfortunately the JS is necessary to completely replicate marquee
behavior, but it's not like i don't use JS on the site already...
***
nov 19, 2024:
* restructured the [now page](/now/)
* updated the [links page](/links/) a small bit

generally respond to guestbook posts but i promise i read them and love them! ^_^

nov 16, 2024: finally did something with the [art page](/art/). (this caused me way more of a headache than it
should've!) the 2023 page is somewhat populated, there's a bit more stuff in the 2024 page. i'm too lazy to add more art
right now
