good evening! it's been a little while since i've written a blog post.

cohost went read-only on the first. i was never really "part of" cohost, i had an account there as a backup just in case things went _really_ south on tumblr, but i never really used it. i had my reasons for not being a big fan of cohost— the site design isn't really to my taste, and i'd prefer more profile customization. still, seeing everyone saying goodbye to it made my heart hurt a bit.

speaking of tumblr, i am once again suspiciously eyeing mullenweg (not like i really stopped) due to all the WPengine stuff. i signed up for [pillowfort](https://www.pillowfort.social/stel) today. the culture seems a little different from tumblr, and i'm not sure how much i'll be using it for the time being, but i thought it'd be nice to get set up there anyhow.

i also discovered (moreso rediscovered, i think i looked at it once before) [schlaugh](https://www.schlaugh.com) today. its whole thing is that it only updates once a day, and you can only post once a day. this slow-web sentiment really appeals to me. i've been contemplating signing up, but i'd feel bad coming onto a platform only to abandon my account. i don't want to put myself on too many platforms.

everything seems so fast-paced online nowadays. i'm mostly off "mainstream" (for lack of a better word) social media now, but my bad habits with youtube seem to be creeping back. discord... i can't really get off discord, unfortunately.

i mostly use tumblr for browsing my dashboard and looking up specific tags— i've hidden the explore page. fedi is also nice, not necessarily slow-paced but it does feel smaller and cozier.

i've also been enjoying using RSS these past couple months. i do feel like i struggle to keep up a bit (one blog i follow in particular seems to post a _lot_) but there does seem to be less pressure.

i'd love to slow down some, but i feel like the world around me (especially academics oh my god) moves too fast for me to afford that at the moment.

a friend and i have been trying to set up a homeserver on one of his old PCs. i've been reduced to emotional support unfortunately (since it's his computer and not mine) and things aren't going quite as smoothly as we'd hoped. hopefully everything will work out! we're planning on hosting nextcloud and some other personal services.

this past week has (so so thankfully!) been a break for 国庆节. i don't feel super well-rested— the pressure of schoolwork is weighing down on me, yet i am too tired to do more than a little bit of work each day.

in other news, i've been getting back into stardew valley a bit the past week. i haven't played the past couple days, but i'm still enjoying watching challenge videos and stuff.

i also watched _the wild robot_ on wednesday! i really enjoyed the movie. i realized that i checked the book out from my school library a couple years ago, but i returned it without getting around to reading it. apparently there's more books in the series! i should read them sometime, but i'm not sure how possible that is at the moment.

that's it from me for now. until next time!
