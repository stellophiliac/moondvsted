![You got to believe in freedom
Be free to believe in the things you dream of
'Cause that's the way that the best dreams can be dreamed of
When you find a way to believe in them
Don't-don't-do, no-no-woah
Dreams make sense
And all the best dreams will be dreamed again
And on the best days, you'll believe again
That the best dreams can be real again
I just found a better way
And I'll scream it out and hope you see it my way
And I know that you might find a different way
And I hope you scream it back at me (Ungh)](./dreams-make-sense.png)
![Slept through every season, I just dreamed the seasons
Does anyone want to know the reason for dreaming?
What's the reason it's pleasing? Can you dream the reason?
How much longer will it be
Before the whole thing changes into a more realistic scene?](./dreamed-the-seasons.png)

^ more than a dream

![My calendar is telling me it's the future](./calendar.png)
![Oh, my memories are coming back in ways
I wasn't ready for
But I'm still enjoying the way it feels
So I'm holding on to the details
Capture this moment
In a series of carefully chosen words and phrases
And then replay it](./coming-back.png)

^ fly around

![Over and over and under and over and
Home again
I wonder if that's somewhere that you've ever been
If it's somewhere that you'd ever go again?](./home.png)

^ 9 8 7

![It's a sad, mad, and bad, glad dream
And I won't get mad about the dream
If you promise to believe in me
It's a sad, bad, and mad, glad scheme
It's the best scheme I have
And that's bad enough for me
And I won't get sad if you don't
See just how mad, glad my schemes can be
](./bad-enough.png)

^ just did a bad thing

![And I'm long gone
And I'm long gone
And I'm right where I belong](./long-gone.png)

^ and the day goes on

![Hello and goodbye
Do you think I'm dying?
Do you think I'm going somewhere else this time?
Do you remember the day we pretended to be every star in the sky?](./hello-goodbye.png)

^ might quit

![But it's 8:45 and I'm on the next flight
It's going around the world
And we'll fly through the night 'til the day becomes bright
Until the night returns](./next-flight.png)

^ at the airport terminal

![Back on the road, back down the road downtown
I don't have courage but I have something else
And it's more than words
I'm ridiculous, I'm feeling very particular
About my world](./down-the-road.png)

![Open the door, close the door
Got to get through the other side of the door
Open the door
Mm, there's got to be more
There's got to be so much more
But I don't know what it's there for
I don't know what we're here for](./open-the-door.png)

^ i'm a princess

![In the real game the points go up to infinity
And the levels go in a circle, and around you go
And the gameplay makes the game fade away
Isn't that peculiar information?](./real-game.png)

^ i'm a huge gamer most of the time

![screenshot of the source code for bill wurtz's site. two stylesheets are loaded, called "main1.css" and "mobile1.css"](./bill-styles.png)
bill's site loads these two stylesheets in each page, but they don't actually have any code

![the stylesheets simply say "oh no wear is my pink tutu"](./pink-tutu.png)

this is the only thing in both of them. everything on his site is styled inline
