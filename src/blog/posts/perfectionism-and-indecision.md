title: "perfectionism, indecision, & letting myself make things"

something i encounter way too often in working on my site(s) is paralyzing indecision about the stupidest things. do the stylesheets go in `assets/style/` or just `style/`? do the image assets go in `assets/media/` or just `assets/`?

i have encountered this again today during my blogsurfing. some bloggers indicate the date of a post in the URL, either with (sometimes-but-not-always hackable) slashes— eg. `blog/2025/01/08/post`— or as part of the actual filename— eg. `blog/2025-01-08-post`. a couple of my older posts are the latter since i used to use [zonelets](https://zonelets.net/), but in recent months i've stuck to just putting the title or a shortened version of it as the file name. i didn't really feel weird about this before, but seeing other people do stuff a different way makes me question what i do. it's not like it really matters— i rarely write multiple posts a month, let alone a day, and duplicate titles probably aren't an issue— but it could be nice for organization or something, i don't know? also, there might be issues since i often draft posts over several days

sort of similarly, i find perfectionism sometimes hinders me when i try to make things. it's not really a problem with visual art because i've done it for years at this point, but it's an issue with writing and music— though it's getting better with the former, i think.

i need to let myself make mediocre or even bad art. i need to let myself enjoy the process of creation— even if it doesn't turn out perfect, i still want to have fun making things! i need to get over the wall of feeling bad because what i'm making doesn't feel right.

i'm think i'm okay with being indecisive. it just means i'm open-minded, or something

- i've been DMing for my and my friends' D&D campaign. we've done two sessions so far, and it's been fun! i'm _really_ bad at improvising, though. i love the organization part (though this is slightly dampened by my indecision in file systems etc.), but actual planning is a bit of a doozy.
- i may move to nekoweb or a different host sometime soon. i saw [mystsaphyr's neocities page](https://mystsaphyr.neocities.org/), and... yikes? i do love the neocities community, but i think my morals outweigh that
- i've been trying to update my gemini capsule more! i don't know how long it'll last, though
- i got approved to run the fanlistings for undertale yellow and murder drones. gotta make those now...
  - if you run a listing on a static site, check out [listingJS](https://git.gay/stel/listingjs) (self-plug)
- my birthday is in around a week. i'm excited to hang out with my friends and stuff [:
- i might post some photos from my winter vacation. maybe? stay tuned
