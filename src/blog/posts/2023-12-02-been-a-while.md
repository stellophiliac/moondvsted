been a while since i posted here. truthfully, i don't really have anything really meaningful to talk about, and i suck at writing. i was working on a draft a couple months back, but i sorta gave up

but i do feel sorta obligated to put _something_ here so it doesn't sit covered in dust, so here are some

## misc. life updates

*   i moved this summer, back to the country i used to live a few years ago when i moved away. nice to see old friends.
*   i made a gemini capsule, a couple months ago. you can find it at stel.cities.yesterweb.org in a gemini browser. i haven't really been working on it as of late, cause my motivation fluctuates a lot
*   i've been working on a [worldbuilding thing](https://toyhou.se/~world/144859.transcendence) lately. if you like sci-fi, maybe give it a look, but there's not much info there yet
*   i got a thing set up so i can edit my site with github, which makes it very slightly easier
*   i'm learning some toki pona
*   i FINALLY started learning javascript despite my reluctance
*   i have finals week next week and i am coding instead of studying. please somebody help me

honestly i don't really know what to write. i kind of suck at writing about myself / my life and that's sort of the entire point of a blog. i mean i could totally write about my interests, but i don't ahve any ideas in the way of that, either.

penelope scott's released some new music recently which i have been very happy about since i've been really into her music since early 2021. her albums have a lot of previously unreleased songs, some that i've been really excited to see so that's really fun for me

i'm one of those people who imagine animatics in their head to music, and penelope's music has been evoking a lot of stuff in my head. i am genuiinely so frustrated i can't just mind beam all of my ideas to my friend's brains. what the fuck do you mean i have to actually _make_ the ideas in my head? what?

i do really wanna add more stuff to my website, but i really don't know what. also, coding is the type of shit that's fun when you're thinking about it but absolute hell to actually do

besides that, nothing new much from me, i guess. if you _do_ wanna see more of me, my [tumblr](https://stellophiliac.tumblr.com/)'s a good place to go. i post my thoughts there sometimes that are too short to put in a blog post

until next time!
