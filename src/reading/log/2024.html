                    <p>enjoyed this book for sure. i feel like some plot points were underdeveloped, and i
                        feel like
                        the ending was a bit too fast-paced. was still overall a fun read though</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>had to read this book for school.</p>
                    <p>wasn't really enjoyable for me. the stream of consciousness style writing is cool in
                        theory, but i feel like the way it was executed made the book really hard to read –
                        especially with the type of language faulkner uses. definitely has interesting
                        themes, though.</p>
                    <p>in terms of characters, i liked cash and vardaman in particular. dewey dell deserved
                        better, and anse is a piece of shit father</p>
