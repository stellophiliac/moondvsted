            <h3><cite>She Gets the Girl</cite> by Rachael Lippincott & Alyson Derrick</h3>
            <p class="text-mono">4.0/5</p>

            <p>enjoyed this book for sure. i feel like some plot points were underdeveloped, and i
                feel like
                the ending was a bit too fast-paced. was still overall a fun read though</p>

            <h3><cite>As I Lay Dying</cite> by William Faulkner</h3>
            <p class="text-mono">2.5/5</p>
            <p>had to read this book for school.</p>
            <p>wasn't really enjoyable for me. the stream of consciousness style writing is cool in
                theory, but i feel like the way it was executed made the book really hard to read –
                especially with the type of language faulkner uses. definitely has interesting
                themes, though.</p>
            <p>in terms of characters, i liked cash and vardaman in particular. dewey dell deserved
                better, and anse is a piece of shit father</p>

            <h3><cite>The Sound of the Mountain</cite> by Yasunari Kawabata</h3>
            <p class="text-mono">3.0/5</p>
            <p>another school read. it was okay, i guess. i liked the themes of aging and memory and the use of dreams
                and newspapers as symbols. shingo is weird about tits and shoulders though</p>
