            <p>goodness, i shouldn't be starting a new book with how much work i have but goddammit this book looks
                short enough and the writing doesn't seem too bad. i'll give it a shot?</p>

                <p>this book was alright. it wasn't riveting by any means (not a bad thing!) it's got sort of a
                    slice-of-life quality to it, for lack of a better term, which i enjoyed reading. there's also a sort
                    of foggy feeling to it, which makes sense given it's all told from sachiko's memory. in particular,
                    i did enjoy etsuko's interactions with her father-in-law. i don't think there's
                    anything weird going on there, i think they just do have a genuinely close relationship. there's
                    also something to say about unreliable narrators here but i don't think i have the words </p>
                <p>i lived in japan for a while, but modern-day japan is obviously going to be different from post ww2
                    japan. still, parts of ishiguro's depictions do feel familiar to me. i also do find it interesting
                    that ishiguro is japanese and british considering the important settings of the book</p>
                <p>i thought the book would pick up much more near the end, but it didn't. this may be because i
                    finished reading the book after midnight, but i didn't entirely know what to make of the ending. i
                    looked at a few people's reviews: there's definitely some sort of parallel between etsuko and
                    sachiko, but i can't really put it into solid words. i will now attempt to do so anyway</p>
                <p>of course, the main "twist" is the book is the brief which to first-person pronouns near the end. i'm
                    still not exactly sure what this means— i do know it's meant to highlight (?) the parallels between
                    the two mothers, but i'm struggling relating that particular situation to estuko. one interpretation
                    could be that sachiko is actually estuko from when she was younger, and the "etsuko" in the stories
                    is present-day estuko "inserting" herself in the position of an outsider. this is interesting, and
                    could be intended, but i think this is more of a metaphorical and/or secondary (??) interpretation
                    of it.</p>
                <p>there's i can definitely see a sort of commentary on the concepts of good and bad in the book. etsuko
                    is depicted as a more kind-hearted, well-intentioned, and possibly naive mother, while sachiko
                    regularly does things that would be considered bad parenting. the similarities between the two
                    women's lives tie into this. their lives are parallel, yet one is portrayed as "better" and one is
                    portrayed as "worse". something to do with nuance... a commmentary on the often black-and-white
                    portrayal of morality?</p>
                <p>i'm not very good at interpreting themes. anyhow, i liked this book and would say it's worth reading.

                <p>holy fuck, that sure was a book! i'm currently writing this right after reading (june 17), so my
                    thoughts are a little messy.</p>
                <p>everything happened so fast at the end – i didn't expect bruno dying, for sure. the ending also left
                    me wondering what happened to guy afterward. it was a hard-hitting ending, for sure, but i do crave
                    more closure.</p>
                <p>this was an easy book to read. the writing style feels sophisticated for lack of a better word, yet
                    it's not too dense or complex. i really really liked guy and bruno as the protagonists. while
                    they're flawed, i saw myself rooting for them as you do any book protagonist. i found them charming
                    too, in a weird way</p>
                <p>there were definitely some vaguely gay undertones, but i see guy and charley's relationship more like
                    a fucked-up brotherly love</p>
                <p><b>update jun 30</b>: i also wanted to add how i love the use of repetition throughout the book –
                    such as with the line "Twelve steps up, skip seven… . You can remember it, it’s got a syncopated
                    rhythm." really helps tie different parts together</p>

            <h3>before reading</h3>
            <p>honestly i don't really understand the synopsis on storygraph (and i'm too scared of spoilers
                to look elsewhere online). i wonder if the narrator will be telling a story about
                himself,
                or if he's making his own story? or some combination, or maybe it's less of a story and
                more
                of like... just his thoughts (since the description references him writing a "narrative"
                and
                i'm not really sure what that entails)</p>
            <p>looks like an intruiging book, i think it'll be interesting to see how this pans out since
                the narrator is isolated and so the book will probably be less about his interactions
                and
                experiences (?) and more about what's going on in his head</p>
            <h3>comments</h3>
            <p>so i was... barely able to start this book honestly. the writing wasn't as wordy as TLHoD,
                but it still
                had huge text blocks that were difficult to read, and the premise just wasn't super
                interesting to me,
                unfortunately.</p>

                </summary>
                <p>finished this book on the last day of the month aw yeah !!!
                </p>
                <p>i wasn't super into this book at the start but i got really
                    invested around halfway through.</p>
                <p>i really liked genly's
                    relationship with estraven and their interactions. estraven was cheering genly
                    on from
                    the start but he didn't trust him until the end. and then he loses him. auhg.
                    auhgshg
                </p>
                <p>i liked the worldbuilding, some stuff was confusing but the
                    author really does well in making us feel like we're
                    reading a story from another planet because. we are</p>
                <p>genly's changing attitude and understanding towards the
                    people of gethen throughout the book was interesting; i
                    personally didn't really get most of the politics stuff (which i KNOW i'm
                    missing out on
                    but i've never had a good understanding of politics)
                    but genly's changing thoughts on gethenian gender i
                    especially liked. i heard ursula k. le guin talked about regretting the use of
                    he/him
                    for gethenians, but i think it makes sense since genly comes from a world with
                    binary
                    genders so it'd feel more natural for him to do that. also love the part where
                    he
                    finally gets a good understanding of gethenian gender and then turns around and
                    describes women in the most misogynistic way</p>
                <p>the ending. holy fuck the ending. tragic. i don't have
                    the words to describe how i feel but auhghg</p>

                    <h3 class="d-inline-block">quotes</h3>
                </summary>
                <p>all of these are from the second half</p>
                <blockquote>“Yet you are. It is strange. I am the only man in all Gethen that has
                    trusted
                    you entirely, and I am the only man in Gethen that you have refused to trust.”
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>“The fact is,” I said, “that you’re unable, or unwilling, to I believe in
                    the
                    fact that I believe in you.”</blockquote>
                <blockquote>Warm through, benevolent, I said, “The best food I’ve eaten on Gethen has
                    always
                    been in your company, Estraven.”</blockquote>
                <blockquote>“Good night, Ai,” said the alien, and the other alien said, “Good night,
                    Harth."
                </blockquote>
