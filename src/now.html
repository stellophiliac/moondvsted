                <li>perhaps a <a href="https://uses.tech" target="_blank">/uses</a> page could be added? not sure if i'd
                    personally have enough content for it
                    though</li>
                <li>page for web cliques? since i submitted a join form for pantson</li>
                <li>need to unfuck the marquees. main thing is the stop-on-hover thing which i could totally remove but
                    that takes away a bit from it .. there's a javascript replacement thing but 1. that's javascript
                    (not like i'm not using js at all though) and 2. it only replicates the scrolling part of the
                    marquee and doesn't have hover events etc.</li>
                <li>not entirely sure what to put in this section as of now. result of my hypercompartmentalization</li>
