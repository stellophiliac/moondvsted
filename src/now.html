                <ul>
                    <li>perhaps i should make an account on <a href="https://www.schlaugh.com/"
                            target="_blank">schlaugh</a>? i like the idea of it.. also might be nice to be somewhere
                        that's a little "more" than a microblog (fedi) but a little "less" than an actual blog. does
                        this make any sense?</li>
                    <li>still have the itch to get a new game! don't know what to get though</li>
                    <li>whether/how to remap my keys once i switch to asahi linux (should i switch at all? linux is so
                        much more customizable but there's nothing that bad about macos)</li>
                    <li>whether to get a google pixel sometime in the future (with grapheneos of course)</li>

                <li>i should find a way to "autogenerate" the art pages, but i'm not very good with eleventy or
                    nunjucks. the art page has always given me a headache ... i make too much art and i'm not quite sure
                    how best to organize a gallery. wouldn't be surprised if i remake the art pages again soon</li>
                <li>i should squash some commits (<a href="https://eepy.moe/notes/a1m4rulol7wv08gn"
                        target="_blank">cough cough</a>) in the repo for my site, but i'm not good enough with git to
                    figure it out</li>
                <li>i'm constantly not-quite-sure about my site's layout. it's really nice, but i also see other sites
                    with ... less floaty? layouts and i feel a bit self-conscious. </li>
                <li>i'd like to mirror the repo for my site onto my personal forgejo account, but it looks like the
                    instance has mirroring disabled. perhaps i can set up push mirroring, or find a way to deploy using
                    forgejo
                    actions instead.</li>
                <li>also, have been thinking about possibly moving off neocities for a bit, but some communities i'm
                    part of operate on neocities.</li>
