she's sitting next to you.
are you paying attention?

she's talking.
she talks. she keeps talking. she keeps rambling, she
doesn't know what she's talking about. her
mouth is just moving by
itself.
are you paying attention?

she stops
talking. you're not listening.
are you listening? you're not listening. she doesn't 
think you're listening. she doesn't
feel like you're listening. she's not
listening to herself, even.
she's not paying
attention to what she's 
saying. you're not paying
attention to what she's 
saying. she stops
talking. nobody is listening. nobody is
talking. she stops talking. 

...

she taps your shoulder.
huh?

head to neck

sorry, i was
talking, she says. were you
listening? you shake
your head. you say you
spaced out. you ask what
she was talking about.
she shrugs.
she doesn't know.
it doesn't matter, she says.
it doesn't matter what she
was talking about. she wasn't
paying attention, anyway. you weren't 
paying attention, anyway.

she points to you
r neck. what 
are you listening
to               ? she asks.
you tell her. she puts her hand
to her chin. haven't heard of them.
you shrug.

you look around. she watches
you look around.
you look around your own room. pillows on 
pillows on blankets on
your bed. you and her on 
blankets on your bed and 
pillows on pillows next to 
you and her on blankets
on your bed.

you space out. it's easy for you
to space out. she sees this. she's 
paying attention. it's easy to space out when you're not
paying attention. she knows this.

...

she grabs your hand.

to that, she says.
you laugh. sorry, i guess i
spaced out. i guess i
wasn't paying attention.

sorry she can't keep your
attention. she laughs
again. you laugh.

doesn't know what she's laughing about. she
looks up at you she
looks away.

fuck, she's sorry. she's just
out of it today, she guesses. she's
apologizing. why is she 
apologizing? she
doesn't know, she says. she
apologizes. she hasn't
done anything to 
apologize for. has she? or
were you not paying attention?

she shrugs. she 
doesn't know. you
don't know and you know that you
don't know and that she 
doesn't know. she knows that
you don't know and she knows that you know that she
doesn't know. you know that she knows that

covers her face with
her hands.
