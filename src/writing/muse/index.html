            [week of aug 19](2024-08-19.txt): reflect on a ritual, whether it's a personal habit, cultural tradition, or invented routine. what does your ritual signify? what happens when a ritual is interrupted or transformed? how does it evolve over time? 
            
            [week of jul 1](2024-07-01.txt): think about the absence of something and how the shape it once filled & now leaves affects things. is it good? sad? bittersweet? write about it.

            <p><b><a href="2024-04-08.html">week of apr 08</a></b>: try to make your writing as silent as possible. i know it's a weird prompt-- don't take it too seriously. have fun. what does it mean for writing to be quiet? </p>
            <p><b><a href="2024-04-01.pdf">week of apr 01</a></b>: explore the concept of time in your writing. play with the idea of how we perceive passing time [linear/cyclical/all at once/not at all] and make it weird and surreal, or maybe go more classic & write some fun time travel/time loop fiction. how does time shape us?</p>
            <p><b><a href="2024-03-25.pdf">week of mar 25</a></b>: try writing in the second person. address your audience and sit with them as you tell your story. see how this direct connection affects how you write. </p>
