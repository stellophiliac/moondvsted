week of aug 19th: reflect on a ritual, whether it's a personal habit, cultural tradition, or invented routine. what does your ritual signify? what happens when a ritual is interrupted or transformed? how does it evolve over time? 

***

* i wash or sanitize my hands before i eat and wipe my mouth after.
    * reasoning: hygiene
    * my friends ask me for the sanitizer when i pull it out. do they not think of cleanliness otherwise?
* at our old house, i used to press down on the faucet lever 5-20 times after turning off the water.
    * reasoning: a couple of times it didn't quite turn off, and i got worried.
* when i open doors with metal handles outside, i brush my hand against the door first.
    * reasoning: electric shocks.
    * electric shocks aren't common outside of winter. i still do this
* i have some daily tasks that i do every day/night for no good reason. these include:
    * snapchat streak
        * i don't even open my friends', i just like seeing the number go up
    * watering my plant on astrobotany
        * i'm not very active on geminispace, but i feel an affinity for my plant and would feel bad letting it die
    * dank memer bot /daily
        * i have no fucking clue why i still do this. i like seeing the number going up and amassing a ridiculous amount of funds i guess
        * holy shit, never mind just checked right now and i lost it (didn't do it for five days. school took up most of my energy)
            * i'm finally free
        * anyways. i HAD a 360 day streak and still have a balance of 221,250,091
        * never touching this fucking bot again man
    * watering my viridi plants
        * i remember to do this every week or so
        * same reason as the astrobotany thing, i feel bad letting the plants die
        * wish there was a vacation mode or something for the mobile version
