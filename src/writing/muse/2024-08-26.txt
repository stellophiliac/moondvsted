week of aug 26: consider someone in your life that you have strong emotions for and think of some sensorial experiences (images) that you associate with them, then write from that!

***

i dreamt i hugged you once
multiple times, actually, but this is the one that
stuck with me.

i told you about that dream
remember?
the one with the sunset and the boats and
whatever

i hugged you tightly
you hugged me back even more so
too much so and i had to pull away but

if i had that dream today i would've held on longer
if i had that dream today i wouldn't have let go

i don't dream of you much anymore
i don't know why that is when i could use it more now
